 Welcome to Candyland! 
 
 To start, you enter how many players will be participating(2-4) and then the ages, as the youngest player goes first.
 If it is your turn, you will draw a card that has one of 3 types, a specified color, and the number of blocks on it. If the card is regular, red and has 2 blocks, you
 will move to the second closest red space to the end goal. It will go back and forth taking turns until a player reaches the final spot and claims victory.
 
 
 
 List of classes created:
 - Board
 - BoardSpace
 - BoardSpaceLicorice
 - BoarSpaceSpecial
 - BoardSpace Regular
 - Card
 - Deck
 - Game
 - InitDeck
 - Player
 
 To run the game simply run Game.java and make sure all the files and classes are within the parent folder called CandyLand. As it stands now, when the game runs it will
 print the board in a straight line, ask for how many players, and determine who goes first. It is incomplete at this time. 
 
 The takeTurn() and the onLanding() methods were key to represent the movement of the player's location across the board, and need to be completed in order to finish.
